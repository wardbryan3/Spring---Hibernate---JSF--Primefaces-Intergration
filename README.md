Followed this tutorial, combined with efficient googling to learn how to get apache running in eclipse, some basic Hibernate annotions, and using beans from the Spring Framework. Currently not fully working due to being unable to figure out how to create databases and schemas. 
I did figure out how to create a schema in Eclipse, but not sure where to put that file, or I am doing something else wrong.
